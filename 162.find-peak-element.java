/*ðŸ§  Logic Behind Binary Search Decision:

    If nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]: peak is left, possibly at mid.

    If nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1]: peak is right, definitely after mid.

This works because:

    If you're in an increasing slope, peak lies to the right.

    If you're in a decreasing slope, peak lies to the left or is the mid itself. */
